# Math-Equation-Solver-With-Steps-Project-

A Math Equation Solver is a tool designed to automatically solve mathematical equations and show the process used to arrive at the solution. It supports various types of math problems—from simple arithmetic to algebraic expressions, calculus equations, and beyond.

⚙️ Key Features
Step-by-Step Breakdown: Shows how each solution is reached, explaining operations applied at each stage.

Multiple Equation Types Supported:

Linear equations (e.g. 2x + 3 = 7)

Quadratic equations (e.g. x² - 5x + 6 = 0)

Systems of equations

Inequalities

Calculus problems (derivatives, integrals)

Interactive Interface: Some solvers let you input variables and see live updates.

Graphical Visualization: Plots equations on graphs to show roots, intersections, or behavior over ranges.
